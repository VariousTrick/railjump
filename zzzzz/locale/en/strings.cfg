zzzzz=RailJump (a fake SE space elevator)

[mod-description]
zzzzz=A standalone Portal Mod that allows trains and players to teleport between paired portals instantly.\n\nArt assets and design inspired by Earendel's Space Exploration Mod, with thanks.

[entity-description]
chuansongmen-entity-restriction=Portals with the same color state must be paired. Warning: When deconstructed, all trains on the portal tracks will be deleted immediately!\nA massive trans-spatial matter projection device. Allows trains and even engineers to move instantly between two distant points.\nHeavily inspired by the SE space elevator. You could say it is the space elevator, designed to work in vanilla games for convenience. But the balance point has not yet been found.

[item-description]
chuansongmen-exotic-matter=A form of matter that should not exist under conventional laws of physics. It appears to be a tiny projection of a higher-dimensional space into our universe, constantly vibrating between existence and nothingness. Although extremely unstable, it contains an energy density that surpasses any known material, making it the key fuel for driving spacetime technology.
chuansongmen-spacetime-shard=The crystalline residue left after Exotic Matter is depleted of its energy. Its internal spacetime structure has collapsed, but the material itself still retains some unique spatial properties. It seems that its energy can be reactivated or recycled in some way. Can also be used for power transmission.
chuansongmen-personal-stabilizer=A highly sophisticated resonance device capable of generating a tiny, localized stable spacetime field. It does not provide energy itself, but it can guide the violent energy released by Exotic Matter, constraining it into a "conduit" that is harmless to organic life. Without its protection, any creature attempting individual teleportation might be torn apart into elementary particles.

You could say it is the space elevator, designed to work in vanilla games for convenience. But the balance point has not yet been found.
chuansongmen-placer=A specialized device used to place portals in the game world. It ensures that portals are correctly aligned and configured for optimal performance.

[recipe-description]
chuansongmen-matter-consumption=Portal Maintenance Protocol - Resource Allocation Summary:\n\n• Train Teleportation: Consumes [item=chuansongmen-exotic-matter] Exotic Matter to power the core engine.\n• Player Teleportation: In addition to the above, also consumes a [item=chuansongmen-personal-stabilizer] Personal Spacetime Stabilizer to ensure life-signal safety.\n• Power Grid Maintenance: Continuously consumes [item=chuansongmen-spacetime-shard] Unstable Spacetime Shards to stabilize the energy conduit.

chuansongmen-power-grid-duration=Power Grid Duration (Minutes), Max: 5

[mod-setting-description]
chuansongmen_show_preview=In the portal interface, show a camera preview of the other portal's location.
chuansongmen-enable-resource-cost=When enabled, portals will consume "Unstable Spacetime Shards" to maintain the power grid, "Exotic Matter" for train teleportation, and "Personal Spacetime Stabilizers" for player teleportation. Disabling this enters a cost-free mode with no maintenance requirements.\n(This is a startup setting and requires a game restart to take effect)
chuansongmen-power-grid-duration=Sets the duration that each [item=chuansongmen-spacetime-shard] Unstable Spacetime Shard can maintain the remote power grid connection.\nThe lower the value, the faster the consumption and the higher the maintenance cost.
chuansongmen-show-power-warnings=If enabled, you will receive a global warning message in the chat when a portal's remote power grid disconnects due to a lack of shards.\nIf you find these messages annoying, you can disable them here.
chuansongmen-show-cybersyn-notifications=Print a message to chat when a spaceship portal automatically suspends (landing) or activates (takeoff) its Cybersyn connection.
